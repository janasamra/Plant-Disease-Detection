ntroduction:
Plant diseases can have a significant impact on crop yield and quality, leading to economic losses and potential food scarcity. Rapid and accurate detection of plant diseases is crucial for timely intervention and effective management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in automated plant disease detection.

Project Overview:
In this project, the aim is to develop a plant disease detection system using CNNs. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can train a model to accurately classify images of plants into healthy or diseased categories based on visual symptoms. The model will learn to extract relevant features from the images and make predictions, enabling early detection and targeted treatment of plant diseases.

Model Training:
The CNN model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves feeding the images through the network, computing the loss, and updating the model's weights using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The model will be iteratively trained on the dataset, adjusting the weights to minimize the loss and improve classification accuracy
